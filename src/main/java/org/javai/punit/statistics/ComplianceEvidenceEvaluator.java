/**
 * Evaluates whether a probabilistic test's sample size is sufficient to contribute
 * to a compliance determination.
 *
 * <p>All PUnit probabilistic tests are <strong>conformance tests</strong>: they check
 * whether observed behavior conforms to the service contract. A conformance test
 * can additionally contribute to a <strong>compliance determination</strong> only
 * when the sample size provides verification-grade statistical evidence at the
 * declared target.
 *
 * <p>This class answers the question: "If this test observes zero failures, would
 * the statistical evidence be strong enough to support a compliance claim?"
 *
 * <h2>Method</h2>
 * <p>Uses the Wilson score one-sided lower confidence bound. For a perfect
 * observation (p̂ = 1.0), the Wilson lower bound simplifies to:
 * <pre>
 *   lower_bound = n / (n + z²)
 * </pre>
 * where z = Φ⁻¹(1 − α). If this bound is still below the target pass rate,
 * even perfect observed performance cannot justify a compliance claim — the
 * result is a conformance smoke test, not compliance evidence.
 *
 * <h2>Example with α = 0.001 (z ≈ 3.09) and target p₀ = 0.9999</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>n = 200: lower bound ≈ 0.954 &lt; 0.9999 → undersized</li>
 *   <li>n = 500: lower bound ≈ 0.981 &lt; 0.9999 → undersized</li>
 *   <li>n = 10,000: lower bound ≈ 0.999 &lt; 0.9999 → undersized</li>
 *   <li>n ≈ 95,500: lower bound ≈ 0.9999 → sufficient for compliance evidence</li>
 * </ul>
